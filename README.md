# IMPORTANT

Adam, right now, follow these steps exactly:

1. `cd` into where you host your local projects (for example, mine would be `cd ~/Sites`)
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/tickyt23/Catagrid.git catagrid` (This will pull down the project into a folder called `catagrid`)
3. Run `cd catagrid`
4. Add the files you're working on inside the `/static` folder
5. Run `git add .`
6. Run `git commit -m "A commit message here"`
7. Run `git push origin master`
8. You might be asked for your username and password. Enter those. Now you're all set.

I could have broken this down into far fewer steps but this way it's super clear what needs to be done.

# CATAGRID.com

(formerly categrid.com [categrid.com is only a redirect to catagrid.com]) 


## Description:

Page of bookmarks where users can store their bookmarks in categories. 


## Round 1: 

Multiple categories are possible but only a grid of nine bookmarks/blocks will ever show at a time. No paging either. 

Bookmarks within each category will be sorted by amount of visits. 

Categories will have a specific color assigned to them.



## For the future:

* Ways to see other users' bookmarks.
* Bookmarks will use a screenshot of the bookmarked site overlaid on the categories' color. 
* Users can upload an icon for themselves.
