CATAGRID.com
(formerly categrid.com [categrid.com is only a redirect to catagrid.com]) 


Description:
Page of bookmarks where users can store their bookmarks in categories. 


Round 1: 
Multiple categories are possible but only a grid of nine bookmarks/blocks will ever show at a time. No paging either. 

Bookmarks within each category will be sorted by amount of visits. 

Categories will have a specific color assigned to them.



For the future:
Ways to see other users' bookmarks.

Bookmarks will use a screenshot of the bookmarked site overlaid on the categories' color. 

Users can upload an icon for themselves.
